    <h1>Disruptive Technologies - AI Predictive Detection Software</h1>
        <p>Disruptive technology is hugely influential on society and our everyday lives. 
            If new technologies are not developed with the end user in mind then it will lead to issues including bias and discrimination. 
            Disruptive technologies should first consider the most vulnerable people in society and ensure their needs are met before thinking of other users.</p>

        <p>China has implemented technology to predict and identify criminal behaviour. It uses Artificial Intelligence to predict criminal behaviour by identifying 
            people with a criminal past acting suspiciously: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/technology/china-surveillance-police.html">'An Invisible Cage': How China Is Policing the Future</a>.
            While this technology can be useful in preventing and reducing crime and it is a step towards meeting the sustainable development goal 16 of Peace, 
            Justice and Strong Institutions it is a violation of privacy and conflicts with goal 10 of Reduced Inequalities. 
            By targeting people who have a criminal past the technology is biased and discriminatory. The Artificial Intelligence may also include bias towards certain types of people based on
            the datasets used to train it.</p>

        <p>Fujitsu has also developed behavioral analysis technology they call 'Actlyzer'. It uses real-time video surveillance footge to detect suspicious activity. 
            Cameras which were installed for recording and deterring people from commiting crimes can now be used to accurately detect and report suspicious activity 
            and criminal behaviour. The issue with training AI to detect and predict these crimes is a large amount of training data is required. Fujitsu combatted this problem by training the 
            AI to recognise complex behaviour through a number of basic actions and movements such as walking and stopping or tilting of the head. This reduces the need for a large amount of training data.
            These basic movements of people can be identified with an accuracy of 90% or more through deep learning.  <br><a href="https://corporate-blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2021-01-20/technology-that-makes-predictive-crime-detection-possible/">Technology that makes predictive crime detection possible</a></p>

        <img alt="Artificial Intelligence CCTV predictive detection" height="300" width="500" src="https://www.sourcesecurity.com/img/news/920/artificial-intelligence-analytics-security-920x533.jpg">
        <p>These predictive technologies can be implemented for other situations as well. One example of this is using the technology to monitor railway tracks and ensure there are no vehicles on the tracks at rail level crossings when a train is approaching. This would reduce rail incidents and ensure smoother operation of public transport services.
            This predictive detection technology is highly innovative and disruptive. It could change the way laws are enforced and save lives. This technology could help to make the world a safer place and help everything from public transport services to supermarkets to run better and more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>While there are many benefits to this predictive detection technology there are also many risks associated with it. The use of this data could lead to a lack of privacy for the general public. While much of this data is already being collected via CCTV surveillance, the implementation of this technology may mean a lot more data is collected and analysed.
            This technology in future could analyse our every move which is quite a frightening realisation. Another suggested use case for this technology is to identify individuals purchasing habits and provide data on their interest in various products in supermarkets etc. While this would be useful it would also be a major GDPR and privacy issue.
        </p>

        <p>Another use case of AI and predictive detection technology is training AI models to identify cancer cells in MRI scans. This technology can be used to identify early signs of cancer, determining the stage of a tumour, monitoring the treatment of cancer to see if it is working and checking if it returns after treatment. In some cases AI can be more accurate than medical professionals with years of experience.</p>

        <p>Dr Stephanie Harmon developed a model to predict the likelihood of cancer spreading. The model looks at digital images of primary tumor tissue to predict whether there are microscopic clusters of cancer in nearby lymph nodes. A study in 2020 proved this model is more accurate than the standard way of predicting whether bladder cancer has spread, which is based on a combination of factors including the patient's age and certain characteristics of the tumor.</p>

        <p>While this technology is impressive and seems to perform well there are still some issues that need to be addressed before it is ready to be used across the world. Some of these AI models reach a conclusion based on lots of factors that can't be fact checked by the doctor using the technology as they are often not aware how the AI reached it's conslusion.
            There is also bias built into the AI as the training data used is often based on priveleged people and there are concerns the use of this AI could widen the gaps between priveleged and disadvantaged people.
            The National Cancer Institute has done vast amounts of research around this topic and have recently published this article discussing the use of AI in cancer treatment and prevention: <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/artificial-intelligence-cancer-imaging">https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2022/artificial-intelligence-cancer-imaging</a>
        </p>

        <p>All things considered, the use of AI predictive technology can be incredibly beneficial in all aspects of life but there are also many risks associated with it that could lead to inequality and bias. If we are to use this technology in the future to improve lives we must first consider the implications it may have, especially how it will affect disadvantaged people.</p>
