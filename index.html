    <h1>Disruptive Technologies</h1>
        <p>Disruptive technology is hugely influential on society and our everyday lives. 
            If new technologies are not developed with the end user in mind then it will lead to issues including bias and discrimination. 
            Disruptive technologies should first consider the most vulnerable people in society and ensure their needs are met before thinking of other users. Consider technologies such as autonomous vehicles. 
            They will change how we use taxis and delivery vehicles. While they may solve some issues such as traffic congestion and reduce road traffic accidents, they are currently only being developed with first world countries in mind that will invest heavily in vehicular automation and do not account for less fortunate people that may not have access to these technologies. </p>
