    <h1>Disruptive Technologies - AI Predictive Detection Software</h1>
        <p>Disruptive technology is hugely influential on society and our everyday lives. 
            If new technologies are not developed with the end user in mind then it will lead to issues including bias and discrimination. 
            Disruptive technologies should first consider the most vulnerable people in society and ensure their needs are met before thinking of other users.</p>

        <p>China has implemented technology to predict and identify criminal behaviour. It uses Artificial Intelligence to predict criminal behaviour by identifying 
            people with a criminal past acting suspiciously: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/technology/china-surveillance-police.html">'An Invisible Cage': How China Is Policing the Future</a>.
            While this technology can be useful in preventing and reducing crime and it is a step towards meeting the sustainable development goal 16 of Peace, 
            Justice and Strong Institutions it is a violation of privacy and conflicts with goal 10 of Reduced Inequalities. 
            By targeting people who have a criminal past the technology is biased and discriminatory. The Artificial Intelligence may also include bias towards certain types of people based on
            the datasets used to train it.</p>

        <p>Fujitsu has also developed behavioral analysis technology they call 'Actlyzer'. It uses real-time video surveillance footge to detect suspicious activity. 
            Cameras which were installed for recording and deterring people from commiting crimes can now be used to accurately detect and report suspicious activity 
            and criminal behaviour. The issue with training AI to detect and predict these crimes is a large amount of training data is required. Fujitsu combatted this problem by training the 
            AI to recognise complex behaviour through a number of basic actions and movements such as walking and stopping or tilting of the head. This reduces the need for a large amount of training data.
            These basic movements of people can be identified with an accuracy of 90% or more through deep learning.  <br><a href="https://corporate-blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2021-01-20/technology-that-makes-predictive-crime-detection-possible/">Technology that makes predictive crime detection possible</a></p>

        <p>These predictive technologies can be implemented for other situations as well. One example of this is using the technology to monitor railway tracks and ensure there are no vehicles on the tracks at rail level crossings when a train is approaching. This would reduce rail incidents and ensure smoother operation of public transport services.
            This predictive detection technology is highly innovative and disruptive. It could change the way laws are enforced and save lives. This technology could help to make the world a safer place and help everything from public transport services to supermarkets to run better and more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>While there are many benefits to this predictive detection technology there are also many risks associated with it. The use of this data could lead to a lack of privacy for the general public. While much of this data is already being collected via CCTV surveillance, the implementation of this technology may mean a lot more data is collected and analysed.
            This technology in future could analyse our every move which is quite a frightening realisation. Another suggested use case for this technology is to identify individuals purchasing habits and provide data on their interest in various products in supermarkets etc. While this would be useful it would also be a major GDPR and privacy issue.
